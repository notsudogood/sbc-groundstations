# the downloader the hash rather than `master` keeps one dl/ tarball per commit,
# so new commits actually refetch. package/devourer tracks its own master the
# same way; nothing pins the two in step any more. The fallback hash is only
# reached offline; GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT/timeout stop a dead remote from hanging
# every make run. Override with `make MABUR_VERSION=<sha-or-tag> mabur-rebuild`.

# devourer supplies the source tree mabur's CMake add_subdirectory()s; the rest
# are real link/staging dependencies, and rockchip-mpp and libdrm additionally
# have to be staged before the pre-configure hook below runs.
#
# No libgpiod: maburplay's record button talks to <linux/gpio.h> ioctls
# directly (gs/player/src/rec_button.cpp), deliberately, so mabur links nothing
# for it. The boards still enable libgpiod-tools for `gpioinfo`, which is how
# you find the line name for a given header pin.
MABUR_DEPENDENCIES = devourer libusb rockchip-mpp libdrm mesa3d librga

# gs/player/CMakeLists.txt links two libraries by absolute path:
#
#   ${MABUR_MPP_ROOT}/lib/librockchip_mpp.a
#   ${MABUR_DRM_ROOT}/lib/libdrm.a
#
# That shape is inherited from mabur's own musl-static cross build
# (tools/build-arm64.sh), where both really are static archives staged under
# toolchain/. Buildroot stages them differently: rockchip-mpp's CMake does
# install a genuine librockchip_mpp.a next to the shared object, but libdrm is
# a Meson package built shared-only, so libdrm.a does not exist in staging.
#
# Rather than patch mabur or turn on BR2_SHARED_STATIC_LIBS for the whole
# build, stage one small prefix that satisfies both cache variables. Both .a
# entries are symlinks to the *shared* objects: ld identifies an input file by
# its contents, not its extension, so it links dynamically and records
# libdrm.so.2 / librockchip_mpp.so.1 as DT_NEEDED. Verify with
# `readelf -d .../usr/local/bin/maburplay`.
#
# Pointing the mpp entry at the shared object rather than the real
# librockchip_mpp.a that rockchip-mpp does stage is deliberate. Buildroot
# installs librockchip_mpp.so.0 (~8.9 MB) to the target no matter what, and
# with pixelpilot gone maburplay is its only possible consumer -- static
# linking would leave that 8.9 MB on the rootfs with nothing referencing it
# AND carry a second copy of the used objects inside the binary. (The staged
# .a itself never reaches the image; target-finalize deletes *.a.)
#
# The header side needs no shim. mabur includes <rockchip/rk_mpi.h> and staging
# has usr/include/rockchip/; it includes <xf86drm.h> and <drm_fourcc.h>, and it
# already adds both ${ROOT}/include and ${ROOT}/include/libdrm, which staging
# provides at exactly those two levels.
#
# Delete this hook if mabur ever learns to link -lrockchip_mpp -ldrm from the
# sysroot directly.

# Mirrors tools/build-arm64.sh, the reference cross build for this target.
# maburd is SigmaStar/armv7 and never built here; the host test suite needs
# GoogleTest; the linkbench/txagcbench tools are not shipped.
#
# The per-chip devourer gates are listed exhaustively on purpose: every
# DEVOURER_<chip> option defaults to ON, so a chip added upstream would opt
# itself into this build on the next hash bump and silently inflate the binary.
# maburplay's record button speaks the v2 GPIO uAPI (Linux 5.10+), which the
# aarch64 external toolchains ship no headers for -- see the long note in
# package/mabur/gpio_v2_compat.h. Force-include the guarded fallback so
# rec_button.cpp compiles; it is inert once the toolchain catches up.
# Prepending $(TARGET_CFLAGS)/$(TARGET_CXXFLAGS) is required, not optional:
# Buildroot's toolchainfile.cmake sets the flags only `if(NOT DEFINED
# CMAKE_C_FLAGS)`, so passing -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS at all takes ownership of them.
# This is the override path that file documents in its own comments.
MABUR_GPIO_COMPAT_FLAG = -include $(MABUR_PKGDIR)/gpio_v2_compat.h

# -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF is load-bearing, not tidiness. Buildroot's
# cmake-package passes BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON (anything but a BR2_STATIC_LIBS
# build), and devourer's `add_library(devourer ...)` names neither STATIC nor
# SHARED, so it honours that and produces an unversioned libdevourer.so.
# package/devourer installs nothing to the target by design -- it exists only
# to put the source on disk -- so maburgs then died at startup with
#   error while loading shared libraries: libdevourer.so
# Every library mabur declares itself is explicitly STATIC, so forcing this off
# only affects devourer, and it links it into maburgs exactly as mabur's own
# cross build does. Our -D comes after Buildroot's on the command line, so it
# wins. Re-verify with `readelf -d` after any devourer bump.
#
# -DMABUR_PLAYER_GPU=ON: the burned-DVR colortrans stage (gs/player/src/
# frame_colortrans.cpp) links EGL/GLESv2/gbm/rga from staging; mesa3d and
# librga are real dependencies again since 2026-09-16 (docs/colortrans.md).

# mabur declares no install() rules -- its own deploy scripts copy artifacts by
# hand -- so the layout is spelled out here.
#
# The two .default.toml files do NOT go to /etc any more. /etc is on the
# read-only squashfs (writable only through the ext4 overlay, which Windows
# cannot read), and the point of the config partition is that these two files
# are editable with the card in a laptop. So they are installed as *defaults*
# under /usr/share/config-defaults, /etc/maburgs.toml and /etc/maburplay.toml
# become symlinks into /config, and /etc/init.d/S00config copies any missing
# default onto the FAT32 CONFIG partition on first boot.
#
# Both files are installed verbatim, and nothing overrides them wholesale any
# more. A board that needs a different default edits the installed file in
# board/common/post-build-script.sh instead -- see the note above
# MABUR_INSTALL_INIT_SYSV.
#
# The symlinks live here rather than in board/common/overlay because that
# overlay is shared with the non-mabur boards (bonnet, orangepi), which would
# otherwise carry two dangling /etc symlinks.
#
# The three assets under /usr/local/share/mabur are runtime files, not linked-in
# blobs: maburplay.toml names font_btfl.mfont and gs_osd.gfont by path, and
# splash.bin is hardcoded in splash_image.h with no config key.
#
# maburtop and maburcal go to /usr/bin, not /usr/local/bin: the GS shell's
# default PATH does not include /usr/local/bin. Both import only the standard
# library, so python3 + python3-curses is the whole requirement -- maburcal
# needs no curses at all, it is argparse/socket only.
#
# maburcal is the TX-power wall calibration kit's entire operator UI, and it
# has to be on the box: `start`/`status`/`abort` speak UDP to CalControl in
# maburgs, which binds 127.0.0.1:8400 only, so there is no calibrating this
# board from anywhere but a shell on it. (`maburcal report <cal.log>` is
# offline and would run on a laptop, but shipping half the tool is worse than
# shipping it.)

# Both wrappers are mabur's own bundled files, installed unmodified.
